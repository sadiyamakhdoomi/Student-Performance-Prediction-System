Student Performance Prediction System

A simple Machine Learning project that predicts student marks based on study hours, sleep duration, and attendance percentage.
Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

Project Overview

This project applies Linear Regression to explore how study habits and lifestyle factors influence academic performance.
It demonstrates fundamental concepts of data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Workflow

Created a dataset of student performance metrics.
Analyzed and visualized relationships between study habits and marks.
Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
Evaluated model performance using MSE, RMSE, and R² Score.
Predicted marks for new input data.
